-: Hey there. Eden here. And before we dive to LangGraph, I wanted to cover two important theoretical concept and terminologies we're going to be using constantly in this course. The first one is going to be graph, the data structure, and the other is going to be state machine. A graph is a mathematical object that helps us represent relationships. It consists of nodes, also known as vertices and edges that connect those nodes. Graph data structures are incredibly versatile and they can be used in a wide range of applications across different fields. We can use graphs to describe social networks, transportation maps between cities and roads and routes between cities. And what's cool about it is that in computer science there is a lot of research on this data structures and a lot of algorithms and property extraction of those graphs that help us solve a lot of problems in the real world. Just as a side note, as a software engineer, I used to work a lot with graph databases, working for cybersecurity companies, leveraging graphs to find and describe attack vectors of cloud assets on public clouds like AWS, GCP, and Azure, and also describe the connectivity of those assets on those clouds. To ask a question, is this web server internet-facing and is it connecting into a database, helping the cloud security posture management? By the way, I'll leave in the videos resources, a talk I gave about this topic in Minsk, you know, Python Developer Meetup discussing this topic in case this interests you. And if we want to geek out a little bit, we can see even the formal definition of a graph, the mathematical definition where a graph G or V and E comprised of V, a set of vertices and E, a set of edges described with a pair X and Y where X and Y belongs to the vertices set. And in case you got worried, then this is the last time we will see math in this course. So, let's continue. And a state machine on the other hand is a model of computation where it consists of states and transition between those states. And by defining different states and the rules for the transition between them, then the states can manage complex conditions and sequence in software systems. And now you can notice that state machines can be represented as graphs where the states are nodes and the transitions are edges. And this visualization helps us understanding the flow of the state machines and to manage their complexity. And here enters LangGraph, a powerful library built on top of LangChain. And with LangGraph we can describe our flows using those nodes and edges, and we can build very powerful and sophisticated agentic applications using it. And we'll see in the course that we'll be describing some very advanced and sophisticated agents, and it will be very easy to write them in LangGraph and to run them. And that's it for this video. I think it was important to have an alignment of what's a graph and what's a state machine before we dive into Flow Engineering and to LangGraph.
