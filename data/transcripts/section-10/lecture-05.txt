-: Hey there, Eden here. And in this video I want to show you some cool resources that the LangChain team has officially curated for us on learning the LangChain ecosystem. So in the LangChain website over here, if I go to Resources, we have here the LangChain Academy. Now the LangChain Academy is a bunch of online courses, which are free, which offer valuable information on how to use and how to build on the LangChain ecosystem. So for example, I show in my course the gist of LangSmith. I certainly do not go in depth and there is a lot of depth in the LangSmith product on tracing, on monitoring, on evaluating our LLM applications. And you can learn more about this in this LangSmith course over here. So let me just show you how to go to this course. Going to sign in into my user. So here I can go and I can enroll for free. And here we have the video lessons. All right, so this is the course. You can see it right now on the left side, you can see all the videos in the different sections. And I think it's a very good course if you want to take an application from a POC and to take it to production. Because if you want to do this, you have to trace it, you have to monitor it, you have to evaluate it on real-time, and you need to collect human feedback on your users. And what answer did you generate? Were they good, were they bad? And overall, this course gives a very good introduction on how to use the LangSmith service in order to do so. Now, I think this is one of the best, if not the best products for tracing, for observability, and for monitoring LLM applications right now. So it doesn't really surprise me because LangChain are the leaders in this ecosystem, at least the way I see it. So you can take a look at the videos and all of the videos comes with resources that you can actually use and you can download, you can check out the GitHub repositories if you want to run things locally or in your notebooks. So I really do recommend it and it's really well curated and it's really well produced. So good job to the LangChain team and I really recommend this course.
