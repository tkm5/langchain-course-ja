All right. So now let's go and let's debug it. And let's examine some objects here so we can get a better understanding. So I'm going to put a breakpoint and run it in debug mode. And let me fast forward everything until we hit this breakpoint here. Let's go and check out the response. And the response is of type a message. And a message is a simple wrapper class on what the LM is going to return us, and it's going to be located in the field of content. So in content here you can see that we have here the answer that the LM generated. Now I message is containing a lot more information like tool calling like how much tokens did we consume. Like how much did it cost. And all of those things. However, we're not going to review all of these features right now. If you want, you can check out the messages video I made where I elaborately go and discuss all the message types in link chain. All right, so let's go and just poke around the I message object. So what we can also find here is that here we can see that the type here is I. And we can also go and check out the response metadata which we're going to have some information about. Which model did we use. What was the finish reason for the LM and will be elaborating a lot about this when we're talking about agents, and we can get the number of tokens we consumed, and a lot of metadata that is useful for debugging and for monitoring and analyzing.
