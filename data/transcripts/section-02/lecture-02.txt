Hey there, Eden here. And in this section we're going to be writing our first link chain, chain. So this is going to be a very simple chain. It's going to be the link chain. Hello world where we're going to take information about Elon Musk. And we're going to send it into an LLM, which is going to summarize this information. And it's going to generate some cool facts about Elon Musk. They call this section is to learn by doing. And I will be introducing the basic link chain constructs that we'll be using in the course in this section. So we'll be learning about prompt templates, about prompts, about chat models, about chains, about debugging and tracing LLM applications. I will be using OpenAI's GPT five for this section, but you can use any first tier LLM that you want like Google's Gemini or Anthropic lot. And in this section I will also be showing how to use llama to run open weights model locally in our machine, and we'll be running Gma3 by Google. So I hope you will enjoy the link chain. Hello world and let's go to the code.
