Let's talk about long chain versions. So this course is compatible with version 1.0.2 which is currently the latest version. So depending on when you will take this course you might have a different version. You can check out the version in your UV lock file. So this is my UV lock file with my link chain version. And it's also attached in the courses repository. And you can see that the version is 1.0.2. When we ran the UV add link chain command, we installed the latest version of link chain available at that moment. Now mostly in minor changes. Then there will be no compatible issues. So they are versions with bug fixes, maybe some new functionality, but nothing that would break your code that was written in prior versions. So let's say you'll be taking the course, let's say one month from now, then probably will be in version 1.0.7 or something like that. So everything should be fine because there were only patches added to the chain version. And what I am referring to right now is semantic versioning. And if there are breaking changes, I update this course in order to match it. So if there are any incompatibilities, please ping me in the discord channel and I will be happy to address issues. But overall in this course, what you see in the videos should match. Link chains latest version.
