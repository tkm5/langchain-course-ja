Hey there. AI eating here? Yes. I am not really eating, but an avatar. This video covers which LLM to use for each project of the course. The table linked in the course resources covers it all. We tested everything from OpenAI's GPT models to cloud Gemini and open source options like llama, Gemma and Deepsea across popular development tools. I will be using OpenAI, but you can do the entire course for free. If you use Gemini on Vertex AI, it will work for all projects. You get $300 in credits, which is more than enough for this course. The table shows which models work best for conversation. Icebreaker, project and genetic algorithm documentation helper and code interpreter project. Hope this will help. Please let me know what you think about this AI generated video.
