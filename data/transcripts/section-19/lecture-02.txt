So let's review the characteristics of Deep Agents. And I want to show you a concrete example how they manifest. And while Deep Agents is a general term, I think the ones who coined this term were the LangChain team. And they did an amazing job articulating this and coming up with this architecture after analyzing a bunch of Deep Agents implementations. All right, so let's go back to the architecture and let's go and talk about what makes a Deep Agent. And let's start with the planning tool. So every Deep Agent you are going to see, it's going to have a planning tool. And here we can see as an example, Claude Code. And here we have a bunch of tasks that are already done. We have one task that is in the making and is currently executing, and after it we have other tasks which needs to be executed. So what we're seeing here is not implicit planning through chain of thought reasoning we know from large language models. Deep Agents use explicit planning tools. And this is typically being implemented as a to-do list in a markdown format. And between execution, the agent is going to actively review and update this plan. So this plan is highly dynamic. The agent is going to mark tasks as pending, in progress or completed. And if we're going to have a task that failed, the agent is not going to blindly retry to do it like we know from the original React algorithm. So the planning tool is going to help us steer the agent. It's going to be continuously updated. And we as the users, we can also influence the task list and the to-do list. And in Claude Code specifically, the planning tool is internal, so we don't have direct access to it, however we can see it executing. And what you're seeing right now is a X post by Boris Cherny, which is the creator of Claude Code by the way. And here you can see the update to do, which is calling the planning tool to update the to-do list. And this to-do list is going to be continuously updated by the Deep Agent. And this is going to yield us better results and to actually accomplish those complex tasks. And when thinking about it, this is pretty intuitive because we as humans, if we have a complex task, we usually want to break it down. We want to keep track of what we have accomplished so far. So this also give us a dopamine rush, you know, to check a task that is completed. And it really shows the progress of our project and something complex that we are trying to achieve. So the idea here is actually very intuitive.
