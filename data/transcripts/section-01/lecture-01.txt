Hey there, Eden Marcus here. And welcome to the Link chain course developer link powered agents with link chain and Link Graph. And this is the third iteration slash edition of this course with all the changes with Lang. And I had to refilm it again. Again. So you would have the most up to date content. And the additional benefit of Refilming it is that I integrated a lot of your feedback to make this course better and better over time. So this is the course introduction. So please, please, please don't skip it. We have some important information here. All right. First of all welcome to the course. I'm super excited to have you here. And I really hope you will enjoy the course. And by now over 200,000 students have taken this course and I received over 40,000 reviews. But most importantly, I've iterated over time on your feedback, doing my best to keep this course better and better and to keep improving. And this is an all new, fresh recording. So after all the feedback I've received, I wanted to reorganize some lectures. I added more real world examples and discussions on topics like security and like production, added new sections, new lectures, and updated all of the code to match Lang chain latest and greatest version 1.0. And it should match the following versions of 1.11.2. To, but we'll wait and see. And I've also added to the video some best practices of long chain to make our code more robust, more usable, and more composable. Cool. So last thing before we finish this video, I wanted to introduce myself. My name is Eden. I come from a backend development background. I was a backend development for many, many years, mostly in cybersecurity companies, and before 2023 I had zero machine learning experience. However, I did jump on the generative AI train when it first came with large language models in 2023. I am a big fan and advocate of link chain. I've been heavily involved with the link chain ecosystem and open source package since its very beginning, and managed to witness the amazing transformation it had making it, in my opinion, the go to framework when building applications. I'm also a public speaker and I speak a lot about developing LLM applications. I'm an official link chain ambassador, and I really believe Link Chain had a huge role of commoditizing machine learning to make it accessible to people like me, with no PhD and no machine learning experience. Right now, I do consider myself as an AI engineer, and we'll talk about this new title more in this course. So that's it for this video. I hope you have a better idea of what you're going into and see you in the next one.
