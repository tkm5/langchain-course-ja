-: Hey, guys, Eden here. First of all, welcome to Udemy. I just wanna make sure you know how to leverage the Udemy platform and Udemy tools in order for you to maximize your learning potential. So in this course, I will be speaking at my normal speed, but if you think I speak too slow, you can speed me up up to 2x. In the other way, if you think I speak too fast, you can decrease my speed up to 0.5x. At some point of the course, Udemy will ask you for a rating. If you're not ready to leave a rating yet, please click on the Ask me later button. If you are ready, you can leave your rating and then click on the star when you're done. I wanna say that your ratings are super, super important for me and for new students. Okay, let's discuss now the courses content and how do I suggest going through this course, and what available resource do you have in it? Generally, I recommend you watching through the courses regular order, section 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and et cetera. Now, it's important to check out the Resource section for each video, where I usually put some useful links to the Discord server, to some Python code snippets, to the documentation, or any other thing that I mention in the video. So be sure to notice the Resource section. Now, all through the course, I do mention the Troubleshooting section, where you can find help for issues you are encountering. And the Theory section, where I elaborate on things like prompt engineering theory or LangChain theory. So sometimes in the course, I mention terminologies like chain-of-thought prompting, the reasoning and acting ReAct paper. So I explain all those theoretical subject in depth in the Theoretical section. You are welcome to check out every time you feel like. If you want to contact me directly, you can do it in a couple of ways. First, you can DM me on the Udemy platform. You can also add me on LinkedIn and send me a message there. And you can join the course's Discourse server, where we have thousands of community members discussing the course's topics. And lastly, the Discord server is a place for you to get help in case you're stuck, if you need some help from me troubleshooting, or if you have some clarifying questions on topics that you did not fully understand. So there are a lot of questions already being asked there. So feel free to join the Discord server and to check out the questions or to post the question yourself in case you need assistance. I will do my best to assist you and to answer you, I love getting messages from students and interacting with students. So please don't be shy if you want to send me a message. This is how I get feedback on the course, which helps me make it better and better. This is also a good way for me to learn about new concepts and new terminologies and new topics, which I continuously integrate to the course again. Cool, so I'll see you in the next video.
