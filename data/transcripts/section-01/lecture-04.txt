Hello, everyone. I Eden here. Yes, this is really I here. I'm really excited to talk to you today about our course discord server, which you can find linked in the video resources and how it's going to enhance your learning experience. I want to share with you the main reasons we've set up this discord server. First and foremost, it's going to be your go to place for getting quick answers to any questions you might have. Whether you're running into configuration issues, having technical problems, or just need clarification about something in the course, the discord server is there for you to get rapid support. The second big reason for having this server is to create a space where we can all engage in meaningful discussions about long chain generative AI agents, rag prompt engineering, and all the fascinating topics we are covering in this course. It's a place where ideas can flow freely and where we can learn from each other. Let me tell you about when you can expect to find me on the server. During weekends, I'll be fully available and checking the server consistently throughout the day. During weekdays, because of my day job, I'll be checking in twice daily, once in the morning and once in the evening after work hours. Now I really want to emphasize something important. Please, please don't hesitate to ask questions. I cannot stress this enough. There are no stupid questions. Every single question contributes to everyone's learning. And I know from experience that when one person asks a question, there are usually many others who had the same question but were hesitant to ask. Whether it's about configuration issues, error messages, or just understanding concepts better, I'm here to help. Quick support from me or your fellow students can save you hours of frustrating debugging. You can reach me through the discord server, which is the preferred method for course related questions, but I'm also available on LinkedIn and through Udemy DM. I'm always open to your feedback and suggestions, whether it's ideas for new topics we should cover or ways we could improve the existing content. I'm here to support your learning journey every step of the way, and I'm really looking forward to connecting with all of you through the discord server. Oh, and one quick technical note if you try to join the discord server and aren't able to for some reason, make sure you're logged into discord before clicking the link to the server that usually resolves any connection issues.
