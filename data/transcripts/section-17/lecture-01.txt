Hey there, Ethan here. So after we have integrated a pre-built NCP server with a pre-built NCP client, now it's time to dive a layer deeper. So in the next couple of videos, we are first going to be implementing NCP servers, and then we're going to be implementing an NCP client, and we'll be integrating the NCP servers that we built with the MCP client that we've built. And we're going to implement the NCP client with the link chain NCP adapter package, and we're going to be converting the NCP servers into link chain tools with these packages as well.
