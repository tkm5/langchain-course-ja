-: Hey there, Ethan here. And in this video, we're going to dive deeper into the SSE MCP server. So in the previous videos, we implemented the weather MCP server, which the transport is SSE. So now we're going to integrate it with the LangChain multi-MCP server client that they made for us. And this client helps us a lot because it actually is able to connect to multiple MCP servers all at once. The cool thing about SSE servers is that we can go and we can deploy them everywhere we want. And the usual usage pattern of SSE servers is to deploy them in the cloud. And if I'll take it to enterprise usage, we can deploy it in our enterprise cloud, and then everyone in our organization can actually make a call to it. And by the way, I didn't talk yet about authentication and authorization. And if we're going to deploy to the cloud, we don't want to give it access to everybody. We want to limit the access to our logged-in users and maybe have some role-based access control and to control who is accessing which tool or not. And this is something which is going to be added, and it's not yet implemented fully in the MCP protocol. But once it will be added, I will be covering it.
