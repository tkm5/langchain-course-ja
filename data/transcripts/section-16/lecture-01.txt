Hey there. Eden here. And in order to fully understand the model context protocol, we need to go through a journey here. Now, I think the best way is to first start by integrating a prebuilt MCP server into a pre-built MCP client here. So in the next couple of videos, we are going to use a pre-built MCP server, which is called MCP dock, which Linkchain released, which is going to give us access to the latest and greatest Linkchain and link documentation. And trust me, those things change fast. So instead of chasing for those updates manually, MCP dock is going to keep us plugged to the freshest Linkchain docks automatically. Now, in the client side, we're going to be using cursor, which has already an MCP client built in. And the cool part is that we're going to do the same. We're going to integrate MCP dock. But this time it's going to be with Cloud Desktop. So by the end of this couple of videos, we are going to be integrating a pre-built MCP server to pre-built MCP clients. Both components are going to communicate through the Model Context protocol.
