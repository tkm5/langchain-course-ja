-: Hey there, Eden here. And in this video, I want to introduce MCP Inspector, which is an open source project by the Anthropic team, which came up with the Model Context Protocol, which is going to help us and enable us to troubleshoot, debug, and trace and to see what actually happens in our MCP server. And this is a super important tool when building MCP servers, which makes your life a lot easier developing them. And this video is only a quick overview and an introduction. And in the rest of the course, we're going to see most of the useful features of the MCP Inspector. So MCP Inspector is an interactive dev tool designed for testing and debugging MCP servers, and it allows developers to inspect and interact with the MCP server without requiring any installation. So it can be ran locally from NPX, and it has a bunch of very useful features that are going to help us once we develop and use MCP servers. We can connect into an MCP server, we can check out the Resources tab, which will list all the available resources and show the metadata and allow the content inspection, which is very convenient. We have a section and a tab on Prompts, which will display the prompt templates, show the prompt arguments, and it will even allow us to enable testing with custom inputs to the prompt templates. And it also has a Tools tab, which will list all the available tools, all their schemas, and will even allow us to test those tools with custom inputs. We also have a Notifications pane, which will present logs and notifications from the server. All right, let me show you this in action. And here I'm going to connect to a server running in my local host, and I'm going to use an SSE server, not an STDIO server. Anyways, let's click Connect and this server exposes tools. So let's go and check out the tools and let's go and list first all the tools. And this specific MCP server is a documentation MCP server, which help us to fetch dynamically the latest and greatest documentation of famous packages. So do not worry about what exactly does the server does, but I want to show you the functionality of the MCP Inspector app. So here you can see after we listed the tools, we have here two tools. One is list document sources. We can even run the tool and we can see what output do we get. And the other is fetch docs. So I can paste here a dynamic input. Let me just fix the input here. And we can see the result of executing this tool. So this playground is very useful for debugging the tools and to see that our MCP server is working correctly.
