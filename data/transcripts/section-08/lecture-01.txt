-: Hey guys, Eden here. So this is a very cool part of this course, and we're going to be implementing something that's called a documentation helper. So we're going to plug in the documentation of a certain package and we're then going to be able to query with the LLM questions about the documentation, how to use it, examples, a lot of very cool and interesting stuff. And we're even going to use it in order to build this tool. So you'll see this dog feeling it's very, very cool. Now we're going to build this end-to-end. So it means running the chain that will get us this result. And also writing the front end and the user interface that will help us interact with it in a very elegant and convenient way. We're going to be cover a lot of topics over here, vector databases, retrieval, similarity search, memory, insider chat, Streamlit as a front end builder. We'll even dive into the lang chain source code to understand what's happening underneath the hood. So the first part of this project is to find a documentation, and we're going to take the lang chain documentation as an example. We're going to download it. We then are going to turn it into vectors. So we're going to take every page in the documentation, chunk it up, and then embed it, turn it into a vector, store it into a vector store, and then we're going to be using that in order to write a chain. So that would be the second part of this project. So in the second part, we're going to be writing a chain that is going to use the vector database in order to find us the correct chunks that we need in order to answer that question. After that, we're going to be implementing the user interface, and we're going to be using a package which is called Streamlit, which is very, very easy to use. And finally, we're going to be integrating memory into our chat. So we want our chat to have the memory ability to reference things that we asked it in the past. So that's an introduction for what we're going to build and let's go build it. And one last request, if you can please find the time to leave me a review on Udemy. This really encourages me as a content creator to continue in growing this course, and it helps other students decide whether this course is a good fit for them. So I would appreciate very much if you can leave me a review. Okay, now let's go and write some code.
