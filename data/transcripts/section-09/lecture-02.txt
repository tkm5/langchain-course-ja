Instructor: In this video, we're going to understand the components comprising of a prompt, and we're going to formally define the terminology of a prompt and its components. Former terminology helps us establish a common language when we talk about AI. This shared understanding facilitates collaboration and makes it super easy for us to communicate ideas regarding AI. So just like in chemistry where we have the terminology or in math that we have different terminology, the same thing will go to AI and to prompt engineering after we'll formally define what is a prompt and what it's made of, it will help us customize our prompts and to optimize it because we'll understand the elements that the prompt is comprised of, and we'll know how to identify and what to address and which part of our prompt would need modification. So let's start by describing what's a prompt when we talk about AI language models? A prompt is the input that we give to the AI model that we wanted to produce an output. You can think of a prompt as a guide for the model, helping it understand the context, to process the information, and to generate a relevant and meaningful response that we can use. We're going to break the prompt into four different components. So let's now describe what are the components of a prompt. The first component is the instruction, and you can think about it as the heart of the prompt. The instruction tells the AI model what task it needs to perform. Whether you're looking for a text summary, or translation, or classification, the instruction sets the stage for the AI's response. Next is the context. So the context provides additional information that helps the AI model to better understand the task and to generate more accurate responses. So for some tasks, context might not be necessary. While for other tasks, it can significantly improve the AI's performance. The next component is the input data. So it's the information that the AI model will process in order to complete the task that we've set. It could be a piece of text, an image, or any data relevant for the task. Now, the last component comprising of a prompt is the output indicator. It signals the AI model that we expect a response now. So sometimes the output indicator is implicit in the instruction, but sometimes it's explicit and we'll see example of it very, very soon.
