Hey there. Ethan here. And up until now, we saw how to use the link chain create agent. And we saw the interface and how we can use it. We still don't really understand what all this magic and how it's working under the hood. And the goal of this section is to help us with the intuition of understanding how it's working. And what is this algorithm? What is this react algorithm which is happening under the hood? And in this section, we're going to be taking a couple of steps back in time. And we are going to review how to use the original link chain react agent. So this is the first version of the agent which was introduced by Lang Chain back a couple of years ago. And this was really what started it all. Now it's important to note that today it is not a recommended way to create agents. The recommended way is to use the Lang chain create agent function, which we already reviewed. By the way, I've been working with many customers, implementing agents, and in reality lots of companies didn't upgrade their versions and they still have those react agents in production. Now this section is super, super important. And we're going to review the OG create React agent. And we're going to see how everything originated. Now in this section we're going to be learning the interface in the section afterwards we're going to really implement it under the hood. And we're going to understand the react algorithm in depth. Now you might be thinking, why are we jumping back in time and learning about this? And trust me, if you want to get a deep understanding of AI agents, this and the next sections are a must. To learn how to use a technology is one thing, and we did it in the previous section. However, to really understand in depth how this technology is built and what was the motivation for the current implementation, what has become better over the years? How this technology evolved to what it is today? It is the deepest layer of depth you can gain in my job here is to dive deep into this because if you want, you can simply check out the docs and you would understand how to use this technology. If you want to learn more, then this is the place for you.
